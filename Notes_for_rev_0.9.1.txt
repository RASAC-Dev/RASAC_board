Power:
Regulator inductors are wrong footprints.
L1, L2, L3
- Footprint too small to fit

Wrong enable signal voltage.
U3
- 12V is TOO HIGH for enable signal and will burn something.
- Recommended to NC that pin connection since it should be the first to power up anyways.

Dual power diodes.
D1
- Voltage drop is too high; find a better suited component.
- Recommeded to add a diode from the other power source as well.

Test/status LEDs.
U3, U4, U5
- Add LEDs for power status indicator for each rail.

Better placement of decoupling capacitors.
C*
- Move around capacitors near to the devices.
- Just overall better placements.

Components out of stock on Digikey
U3, C24, C26, C28

FPGA:
Configuration header has wrong footprint/schematic symbol.
J13
- Symbol has counter-clockwise numbering while footprint has even/odd numbering.

Configuration flash is not supported.
U10
- Replace with a supported one. (Ordered MT25QU128)
- Also, wrong size footprint.

EMCCLK on wrong pin/no user clock.
U8
- Use a MRCC or SRCC pin.

Incorrect bank voltages.
U1
- Bank 15 should receive VCC3V3.
- Recommended to reorganize pins by function and necessary bank voltage.

GPIOs
U1
- Add some GPIOs and LEDs for easy debugging and testing.
- And a few more test points.

USB and JTAG:
USB Type-C needs extra Power Delivery pins.
J4
- Type-C connections require CC pins.
- Recommeded to add 5.1k resistors from CC1 and CC2 to GND.
- This signals that it's a power sink by having Rd pull-down resistors.

Better JTAG chip
U6
- Possibly find a better chip to use.
- Currently using "Papilio Loader" to load bitstreams. (Is open source)
- The jumps on TDO/TDI were a gread idea.

Have not tested HDMI

To get Rev 0.9 working, fix the above
- The inductors were soldered with wire extensions
- Config header had a plug with correct mappings
- Soldered a LED + resistor to net HDMI_R_D0 on R32 (Pin N14)
- EMCCLK, as well as connected on PCB, was connected to net HDMI_R_D7 (Pin P14)
- D1 was either shorted across or replaced with A15F
- Connect CC1 and CC2 of J4 to ground via 5.1k pull-down.
  This was done via connecting enameled wires to the pins and soldering the connector itself on the other side of the board.
- The FT2232 (U6) cannot do JTAG directly, but rather JTAG via its MPSSE mode, which does not work with Vivado or most tools.
  After configuring the chip, Papilio Loader can be used to program the FPGA and the SPI, or FTDI provided libraries to wrie custom loaders.
